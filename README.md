# Parkinsons

**Overview:** ðŸ‘“  

My Final Year Project was a group project, during my Bachelorâ€™s, and was about creating a Machine Learning Android-based app that would be used to detect Parkinsonâ€™s disease in the patients, by analyzing the voice patterns. 
The Machine Learning phase involved working on 4 algorithms KNN, SVM, Boost, and Random Forest. Out of which I worked on KNN and SVM.  

KNN Accuracy: 87%  

SVM:86 %
